## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lot building out this project, and it was a great experience for me to build it out and fix all the bugs I came across. Adding in the increasing difficulty of using TS and trying to figure out the context/reducer pattern and I had my work cut out for me for sure. I honestly feel like my logic was actually much better than the design. I had quite a bit of problems with CSS which I already thought I knew quite well. But the harder the design file is the more I learn. I would honestly appreciate if someone explained to me how I should make the pictures smaller while keeping the grid intact. I also wrote utility functions that I can reuse over my codebase, and I also added two custom hooks to make it easier for me to work with my context/reducer and to add products in the cart into local storage.
Overall I learned a ton and I also learned how little I actually understand some topics which I intend to get better at going forward.

### Continued development

My plan is to keep on improving my react knowledge, along with learning TS better. I also want to start using either css modules or maybe even tailwind since it's becoming a hassle to constantly switch between the component I'm working on and the css file.
